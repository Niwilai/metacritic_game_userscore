# metacritic_game_userscore
It annoys me that I cannot search PS4 games by User score on Metacritic, little scraper to solve it

Edit: Pretty much redundant now as one can now filter by User score!

# Usage
python score.py (any argument for recent games)

# Dependencies
- python2
- lxml
- requests
- sys
